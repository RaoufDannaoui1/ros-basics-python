## Brief Summary

ROS In 5 Days is the ideal course if you are new to ROS.The objective of this course is to give you the basic tools and knowledge to be able to understand and create any basic ROS related project. You will be able to move robots, read their sensor data, make the robots perform intelligent tasks, see visual representations of complex data such as Point Clouds and debug errors in the programs.

## What You Will Learn

In this course you will learn:

    1. Understand key ROS concepts
    2. Understand and create your own ROS programs
    3. How to debug your ROS programs
